# Overview

This program has been created to demonstrate my abilities with the c++ programming language. In demonstrating my abilities, I have chosen to create a program that performs some simple credential verification.

When running the program, the user can "create an account" with a username and password that will then be linked to each other so the user may "login" using their newly created credentials.

You can view a demonstration of the program here: [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Development Environment

* C++
* Visual Studio Community
* Git / GitHub

# Useful Websites

* [Geeks for Geeks: C++ Vectors]([http://url.link.goes.here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/))
* [Geeks for Geeks: C++ Iterators]([http://url.link.goes.here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-c-stl/))

# Future Work

* Add writing to file to save created credentials after program ends.
* Add file reading to allow program to read old saved credentials.
